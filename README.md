# Open Maps App


`open-maps-app` is a cross-platform, modular mapping framework designed for use in both desktop and mobile browsers. It supports dynamic switching between multiple maps, each with its own unique functionality, while maintaining access to a shared set of base layers. This design allows for a flexible and extensible architecture where individual maps can be tailored for specific use cases without duplicating common infrastructure.
The system enables users to seamlessly explore different geographic data views within a consistent interface, promoting both reusability and scalability. Its architecture emphasizes maintainability, with clearly separated components for data management, rendering, and user interaction.
